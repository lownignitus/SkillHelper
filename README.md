SKILL HELPER

is an add on that was developed to track skill progression. It will alert you when training is required to increase your cap so you don't waste time picking herbs or mining nodes without knowing you aren't getting skill points (among other skills as well to prevent the waste of mats). The addon has its own action buttons that relate to each skill so that you don't have to clutter your action bars or open the profession window to access these. There is a toggleable frame for 1 click Skill Links, allowing you to link a skill without opening the crafting frame. There are buttons for hiding the SH addon, toggling the frame lock, opening the Links frame, and opening the Spellbook Professions tab with 1 click. A Mini Map Icon was implemented to perform all slash command actions, but the slash commands are still available:

Skill Helper Slash Commands

    type /SHelper toggle to toggle the addon hidden state
    type /SHelper lock to toggle locking
    type /SHelper links to toggle the Skill Links frame
    type /SHelper reset to reset to default position
    type /SHelper mmtoggle to toggle the minimap button on/off
    type /SHelper options to open addon options
    type /SHelper info to view current build information

General Options for Mouseover, Mouseover Alpha, Minimap toggle, and AddOn Scale have been added.

Future possible development for Skill Helper is still under way. Some features that are planned to be implemented include, but are not limited to:

    Links to skill guides to assist in most efficient paths to leveling your trade skills
    Code optimization
